Welcome to Mega Man Battle Royale! Choose a character (the gray ones don't work yet) and battle it out with a friend on a stage of your choice. I created this game using HTML5, and the programs I used were Sublime Text 2, GIMP, Paint, and Nestopia. I'm having a blast with this project, and hopefully I'll be 100% done with it by the end of 2015!

Current version:	0.4
Project start:		October 18, 2014
Project packaged:	December 25, 2014
Project end:		???

All characters and concepts (c) CAPCOM.
Various artwork by me.

# How to Play #
###############


**CHARACTER SELECT**
- Select a character with the directional keys (WASD or arrow keys).
- Choose a character with the 'START' or 'A' ('K' for P1, 'G' for P2) buttons.
- Cancel your choice with the 'B' button ('L' for P1, 'F' for P2).
- When both characters are ready, you are transported to the STAGE SELECT.

**STAGE SELECT**
- Select a stage with P1's 'LEFT' and 'RIGHT' keys.
- To access the Time/Stock bar in the upper-left, press P1 'UP', then the P1 'LEFT' and 'RIGHT' keys to choose the blinking option of your choice. Use P1 'START' or 'A' to select said option. Then, use the P1 'UP' and 'DOWN' to select your option, then P1 'B' to exit, and P1 'DOWN' to return to the bottom stage select bar. (It gets simpler when you actually stop reading and try it.)
- Press P1 'START' or 'A' to select a stage. After this, BATTLE MODE begins.
- There's a selection on the far right that allows you to return to the CHARACTER SELECT.

**BATTLE MODE**
- Press 'A' to jump.
- Press 'B' to attack.
- During battle, press 'START' to pause the game.
- Press 'SELECT' to use E-Tank (if available in inventory)

# "Balanced Characters" #
#########################

I wrote "Balanced Characters" in quotes, since these characters may not be truly balanced yet. However, they are fully playable (to the point where you can fight with them without much frustration) and I probably won't be working with them for a while.
- Ice Man
- Bomb Man
- Fire Man
- Elec Man
- Metal Man
- Air Man
- Quick Man
- Wood Man (I think he fits here.)
- Magnet Man
- Gemini Man

- Hold 'B' as Heat Man to charge your dash attack.
- Hold 'B' as Flash Man to charge the Flash Stopper, then release to freeze time.
- Hold 'B' as Magnet Man to pull the opponent toward you.
- Hold 'B' as Top Man to spin rapidly.
- Hold 'B' as Spark Man to charge Spark Shock, then release to fire a deadly projectile. Great at close range!
- Press 'Up'+'A' as Needle Man to latch onto things with your head.
